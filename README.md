       I support to users with empathy and translate the information into IT in a technical mindset.!
       
Hello!
I am a bilingual (Spanish/English) Business Administration professional with experience in customer service, user support,onboarding and incident management in systems such as SaaS, CRM (Dynamics 365) and ERP within private banking and financial environments.
I am currently strengthening my technical skills with knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which allows me to better understand the systems users interact with, collaborate effectively with IT teams, and support incident resolution more efficiently.
I help facilitate communication and workflow between users and IT teams.
My background in digital consulting, user training, and multichannel support now combines with a growing foundation in programming, demonstrating my adaptability and commitment to continuous growth. 
I invite you to explore my portfolio of small projects here: github.com/DinicaCB/SmallProjects.
